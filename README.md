## chemical - molarMass

Calculate the molar mass of one substance.

For example, input:

```text
CaCO3
```

and you'll get `100` cause `(C)12 * 1 + (Ca)40 * 1 + (O)16 * 3`.

It also allows substance with brackets. For example, input:

```text
Al2(SO4)3
```

and you'll get `342` cause `(Al)27 * 2 + (O)16 * 12 + (S)32 * 3`.

But it only allows frequently-used elements in senior high school now.

## wordle-generate

A simple wordle game. It will choose a word and you can play wordle with the program.

## wordle-guess

It will help you guess the answer of the wordle while you're playing it.

When you get yellow, green or brown in wordle, just tell the program, and it'll tell you another possible word.
